# My First React Project

## Introduction

This is my first project using React, where I learned the fundamental concepts of building React applications. The project involves creating a simple interactive game (like Tic-Tac-Toe) that allows two players to take turns and display the winner.

## Lessons Learned

1. **Creating Components**: Gained experience in creating functional components and managing their lifecycle.
2. **Updating State Based on Old State**: Learned how to update state by relying on the previous state values for consistency and accuracy.
3. **Immutability in React**: Understood the importance of immutability and how it helps in tracking changes and re-renders efficiently.
4. **Lifting State Up**: Practiced lifting state up to share data between components, enabling a more cohesive application.
5. **Managing Duplicate State**: Identified and eliminated unnecessary duplicate state variables to streamline the application.
6. **Deriving State**: Developed the ability to derive values based on existing state, reducing redundancy and enhancing performance.
